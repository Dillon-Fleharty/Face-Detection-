# Face-Detection-

  The objective of this project is to design and implement a a face detection system using ```AdaBoost``` combined with rectangle filters and ```classifier cascades```. A crucial goal is the effective integration of AdaBoost for feature selection and classification. Another aspect of the project is incorporating skin detection algorithms to enhance the efficiency and accuracy in the use of color images. This use of skin detection will help reducing the computation overhead and improve the systems ability to focus on relevant areas. 
    Further, the project aims to implement a cascade of classifiers, optimizing the balance between speed and accuracy. Overall, the goals of this project are to achieve a high degree of accuracy in face detection while maintaining a reasonable computational load. 
    All project files and source code are provided along with example test output images and accuracy scores.
